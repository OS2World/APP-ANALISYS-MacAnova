TARGET: macanova # for gcc or cc

# In order to use the readline line editor and history maintainer, macro
# READLINE must be defined.

# Header files readline.h and history.h need to be accessible if READLINE
# is defined in Makefile.  Since readline.h includes keymaps.h which
# in turn includes chardefs.h, these too must be available.  Version 2.0
# keymaps.h also requires tilde.h

# If READLINE_LIBRARY is defined, all readline header files are included by
# e.g., #include "readline.h"; if not defined, they are included, e.g., by
# #include <readline/readline.h>. In version 2.0 of readline, any includes
# triggered by including readline.h are also controlled by READLINE_LIBRARY
# Activate -DREADLINE11 if readline 1.1 is used (see macro READLINE11)

# Activate one of following to change default INPUTRC file
READLINERC =#-D'DEFAULTINPUTRC="filename"' #substitute desired name
#READLINERC =-D'INPUTRCFILE="CompletePath/filename"'

# as to avoid invoking yacc.  Since many makes have assume dependence of
# foo.c on foo.y if foo.y exists, to avoid invoking yacc it may be
# necessary to rename mainpars.y and mreader.y to, say, mainpars.yy and
# mreader.yy.  This is done automatically by the installer.
