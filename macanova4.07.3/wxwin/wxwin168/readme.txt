The files in this directory are minor modifications of the corresponding
files in the version 1.68 distribution of WxWin (Copyright: (c) 1993,
1995 AIAI, University of Edinburgh).

Changes can be located by searching for GWO.  It should be clear what
changes were made.

At present, only a single file for the Windows version, msw/wx_text.cpp,
has been modified.

A compressed tar archive containing the full WxWin 168 distribution is in
file
  ftp://ftp.stat.umn.edu/pub/macanova/src/macanovaV.VV.R.tar.gz
where V.VV is the version number (e.g., 4.07) and R is the release number
(e.g., 2).  It contains unmodified files.
