                     Files for Testing MacAnova

Directory testfiles contains various test input files and output from
them produced by the HP/UX gcc version of MacAnova (almost identical to
files produced by the HP/UX cc version).

    Input files           Output Files
  TestChapter2a.in   TestChapter2a.out.unx
  TestChapter2b.in   TestChapter2b.out.unx
  TestChapter3.in    TestChapter3.out.unx 
  TestChapter4.in    TestChapter4.out.unx 
  TestChapter5.in    TestChapter5.out.unx 
  TestChapter6.in    TestChapter6.out.unx 
  TestChapter7.in    TestChapter7.out.unx 
  TestChapter8.in    TestChapter8.out.unx
  TestChapter9.in    TestChapter9.out.unx
  TestChapter10.in   TestChapter10.out.unx

All testfiles are based on examples from the indicated chapter in the
MacAnova 4.07 manual, with Chapter 2 split into parts a and b.  No claim is
made that they test all features.  They are particularly weak on testing
MacAnova's responses to errors.  We welcome any additional test files that
could test MacAnova more thoroughly.  A few things cannot be tested in
when the files are tested as batch files, the only way to use them in
windowed versions (Macintosh, Windows, Motif).  

                             Additional files
data/Hald     Contains Hald data in form readable by vecread() and
              readcols.  Should be moved to the "home directory", that is
              directory $HOME  on  Unix or the directory containing  the
              MacAnova executable file (Macintosh, Windows, DOS).
mybatch.txt   Short file of MacAnova commands to be executed by batch()
mybatch1.txt  Short file of MacAnova commands to be executed by batch()

The following are also included here, but should not be necessary if
MacAnova has been installed correctly.

MacAnova.dat  Contains various sample data sets readable by matread()
MacAnova.mac  Contains macros used by test files
Tser.mac      Contains time series analysis macros used by test files

       Creating output files for comparison with the *.out.unx files

Most of the commands below assume that testfiles is the current default
directory and that it is a subdirectory of the directory where the
executable files are located.  NN should be one of 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9 or 10.  On DOS/Windows, the examples assume the test input files have
been renamed testNN.in.

Unix non-Motif:
  Create a output file for comparison by
    ../macanova < TestChapterNN.in > TestChapterNN.out.unx.new

Unix Motif:
  Create a output file for comparison by

    ../macanovawx -b TestChapterNN.in -bprompt 'Cmd> '

  When all the commands from the testfile have been executed, select Quit
  from the file menu (Ctrl+Q) and in response to the dialog box questions,
  don't save the work space, but save the window in, say
  TestChapterNN.out.wx.

DOS non-windows (macanoXX, where XX is dj or bc)
  Create a output file for comparison by

    ../macanoXX < testNN.in > testNN.new

  Since macanobc does not implement gethistory() and sethistory(), its
  output from test8.in will have some discrepencies.  Also, memory
  limitations may prevent some commands from completing, especially when NN
  is 5.
  
Windows version under Windows 95
  Create a output file for comparison at the DOS prompt by
    ../macanowx -b testNN.in -bprompt "Cmd> "

  The output from several of the testfiles is too long for a single window
  to hold and MacAnova will automatically open new windows, giving you the
  opportunity to save the window just filled.  Save it as, say, testNN.wx1,
  testNN.wx2,... .  When all the commands from the testfile have been
  executed, select Quit from the file menu (Ctrl+Q) and in response to the
  dialog box questions, do not save the work space, but save the window in,
  say TestNN.wxM, where M is 1 if no window has previously overflowed, M is
  2 if one window overflowed, etc.  You can then combine the files together
  using an editor or otherwise.

Windows version under Windows 3.1 with Win32s
  This is more difficult since you cannot start Windows programs from the
  DOS prompt.  One way is to use Run on the Program Manager File menu.
  Assuming macanowx is in directory C:\macanova and the test input files
  are in c:\macanova\testfile, type
    C:\macanova\macanowx -b c:\macanova\testfile\testNN.in -bprompt "Cmd> "
  and then proceed as under Windows 95.

  Alternatively, you can startup MacAnova for Windows by clicking on its
  icon.  Then type batch("", prompt:"Cmd> ") at the prompt and find
  TestNN.in using the dialog box.

Macintosh
  Start up MacAnova by double clicking and immediately press the command
  key ("daisy" or "apple") to bring it up in non-interactive mode.  The
  first dialog box asks where the output should be saved.  Provide a name
  like TestChapterNN.out.mac.  Then you will be asked to select the input
  file.  Shortly a dialog box with a single Interrupt button appears and
  eventually you are asked if you want to save the workspace.

It is unlikely you will get exact matches but there should be very close
agreement.  Different compilers, even on the same computer, have
different rounding behavior.  This may affect the positioning of labels
on the dumb plots created by some of the test files.  On eigenvalue
computations, you cannot expect eigenvectors corresponding to 0
eigenvalues to match, even approximately.  One problem with the DOS
limited memory version (BCPP) is that it traps on overflow, defeating
MacAnova checks that translate infinity to MISSING and causing an abort
of the executing of testX.in.  In addition, you may not have have enough
low memory to do everything.
